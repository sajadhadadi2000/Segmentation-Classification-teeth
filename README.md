# Segmentation by SAM and Classification-teeth

## Problem:

Consider a dataset of radiological images of teeth. First, you separate the image of each tooth by using segment anything, and then perform the classification operation according to the data in the csv file. Note that each tooth can have one of the 5 available classes as a target.

## Objectives:

1. **Image Segmentation by SAM:** Implement image segmentation using the SAM (Segmentation Anything Model) to accurately delineate regions of interest within the images.
2. **Custom Dataset:** Create and curate a custom dataset tailored to the specific requirements of the image segmentation and classification tasks.
3. **Classification:** Develop and optimize classification algorithms to accurately categorize segmented regions into predefined classes.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train the segmentation and classification models on the custom dataset and rigorously evaluate their performance to ensure robustness and accuracy.
